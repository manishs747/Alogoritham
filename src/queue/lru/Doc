Lru:Lease Recently used.

The LRU caching scheme is to remove the least recently used frame when the cache is full and a new page is referenced which is not there in cache.

Queue which is implemented using a doubly linked list. The maximum size of the queue will be equal to the total number of frames available (cache size).
The most recently used pages will be near front end and least recently pages will be near rear end.
A Hash with page number as key and address of the corresponding queue node as value
